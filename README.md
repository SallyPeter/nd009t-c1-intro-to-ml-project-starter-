In summary, after I had tried optimizing in different ways, I can say that the tunning of hyperparameters are great in improving models 
as well as their accuracy scores in prediction but it is not always the case. This is because knowing the right hyperparameters to tune 
as well as having a good understanding of the features in the dataset is of great importance as these greatly affect output.
Also, Autogluon is a good tool as it helps test several models in one go.
